This is an utility to measure the basi blocks coverage of all testcases in the
AFL queue using a patched QEMU.

Written and maintained by Andrea Fioraldi <andreafioraldi@gmail.com>

Usage
-----

To count the number of basic blocks covered by all the testcases in the queue
run bb_cov.py:

$ ./bb_cov.py /path/to/AFL/queue -- ./binary <args>

To count the number of basic blocks covered by the testcases in the queue on
demand while fuzzing run bb_cov_monitor.py:

$ ./bb_cov_monitor.py /path/to/AFL/queue -- ./binary <args>

This script will create the file bb_cov_monitor_data in the current directory.
This file contains pairs (unix timestamp, number of new basic blocks) similar
in spirit to the plot_data file of AFL.
