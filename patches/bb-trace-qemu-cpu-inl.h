   This code is a shim patched into the separately-distributed source
   code of QEMU 2.10.0. It leverages the built-in QEMU tracing functionality
   to implement AFL-style instrumentation and to take care of the remaining
   parts of the AFL fork server logic.

   The resulting QEMU binary is essentially a standalone instrumentation
   tool; for an example of how to leverage it for other purposes, you can
   have a look at afl-showmap.c.
